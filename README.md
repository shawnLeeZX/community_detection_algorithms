In this repo, five clustering(community detection) algorithms are coded:

* Average Link Agglomerative Clustering with Jaccard similarity.
* Girvan-Newman algorithm.
* Ratio Cut.
* Normalized Cut.
* Modularity Maximization.

## Note
* Subroutines of kmeans clustering algorithm comes from the code written when I
  was learning the Machine Learning Course taught by Andrew Ng.
* K means code is duplicated in folder: `ratio_cut`, `normalized_cut` and
  `modularity_maximization`.
* There is a function called `write_clustering_results_to_file.m` to record
  your clustering results into files.
